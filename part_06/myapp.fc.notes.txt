myapp.fc defines the file security contexts, it has the following content:

  1/usr/bin/myapp	--	gen_context(system_u:object_r:myapp_exec_t,s0)

The /usr/bin/myapp binary will have context with the type myapp_exec_t when 
running commands like restorecon, fixfiles.

There is a service that restores file context automatically. It is restorecond 
service.
  systemctl status restorecond

However, this service only applies to files and directories listed in the 
configuration file /etc/selinux/restorecond.conf. By default the binaries in 
/usr/bin are not applied. 
To clarify this, we copy myapp into /usr/bin and see its security context, as 
the root user:
  cp myapp /usr/bin/
  ls -Z /usr/bin/myapp

The type of /usr/bin/myapp is bin_t rather than myapp_exec_t as we wish.
Now we add /usr/bin/ * to the /etc/selinux/restorecond.conf configuration file, 
the result is as expected.

Here the security context computing process preserves the user field of the file 
security context, which is root. If you want, you can change it to system_u by 
running the command chcon, as the root user:
  chcon -u system_u /usr/bin/myapp

You can also set the file context permanently by running the semanage command 
as follows:
  semanage fcontext -a -t myapp_exect -s system_u /usr/bin/myapp
  restorecon -F /usr/bin/myapp
